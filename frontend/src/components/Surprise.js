When we started having something years ago I always thought we would get married. I remember when people would tell me it was something that wouldn’t last but I was always sure we would make it work. Our age, the distance, the language barrier, nothing really mattered because since the moment I met you, I have been sure of one thing, you are gonna be the person I spend my life with. 

As I said already, you make my life better. I do not wanna imagine a life without you, you are the reason why I wake up every single morning, why I try so hard to be someone in life. You make me feel alive and actually enjoy life. You make me feel the luckiest girl in the world for having such a beautiful girl by my side who loves me even if im annoying and dramatic. 

I have been wanting to ask this question for a really long time. I have always dreamed of it being perfect and maybe this isn’t what you expect but I hope you like it because it’s made with love. A love you’re the only one to get because this type of love I feel, can only be felt once in a lifetime and you can be sure, I will find you in every lifetime so you be the one to get it.   

When we decided some weeks ago that we would make it work, I realized that I wanted to do it right this time. I  know we are really far away but you are worth waiting for, you are worth fighting for and if we have to try a million times, I would do it. As long as I get the pretty girl, the girl who is definitely my soulmate, I would try over and over again. 

I want you to be my wife yes, I wanna marry you in the future but I also want you now.  I want you to be my girlfriend now, I want you to be the person im compromised to, the person I have something with, the person I can call my girlfriend and no one can tell me otherwise, the person I work through it all, I want you to be me and you against the world, I want us to have each other. I want you to be the only one, the one everyone knows about. 

Jeg liker deg veldig godt. Du er digg, vakker, morsom, og jeg er så glad for at du er i livet mitt. Jeg gleder meg til å dele livet mitt og dagene mine med deg. Du er min livs store kjærlighet og det er noe jeg vil gjøre med deg like gåtur, ligge på armen min og se en serie sammen. Jeg er veldig forelsket i du og du er god å være med meg. Så jeg har et spørsmål jeg gjerne vil stille

Vil du gjøre meg den ære å bli kjæresten min og tilbringe resten av livet ditt sammen med meg?`;
