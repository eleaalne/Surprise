There are many things that remind me of you. You are a constant thought on my mind and to be honest my favorite one.

I have been thinking of you daily for years by now but one thing i really enjoy, its making up fake scenarios in my head while listening to music. Like me and my wife dancing in the kitchen, going for a walk, kissing, doing a karaoke night or just having my favorite dessert ;)

That's why i made a playlist with some songs that remind me of you. I tried to organize it a bit so its first spanish and then english. You may wonder why there is a spanish song at the end and that is because that is your song. Here is a little secret, I realized i liked you because of that song and mi amor that song explains exactly how i feel and what i want with you so i do dedicate it to you. 

I hope you enjoy the playlist so here is the link:
